## Secure, Unified, Powerful and Extensible Rust Android Analyzer

**Welcome to SUPER!** Here you can find all the information relevant to the SUPER Android Analyzer.
You can find news too, and of course, the downloads. SUPER is a command-line application that can
be used in Windows, MacOS X and Linux, that analyzes *.apk* files in search for vulnerabilities. It
does this by decompressing APKs and applying a series of rules to detect those vulnerabilities.

SUPER has been developed in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a systems programming language that
gives performance similar to well-written C/C++, while avoiding memory leaks, data races, and
giving memory safety. This programming language was selected to improve all the Java or Python based
alternatives. It also gives us the ability to perform much more powerful checks faster.

## Usage

To use SUPER you will need to configure in the `config.toml` file the paths of `vendor`,
`downloads` and other folders. If the package was installed using one of the provided packages,
the default configuration will work. If not, probably the same folder where `super` is called from
will work (usually the installation folder, or the current workspace). If willing to use other
paths, a sample configuration file can be found in the `config.toml.sample` file.

Lots of parameters can be configured in that file, such as the threads that will be used for the
analysis or the rule file. We currently require some Java dependencies that are included in the
packages. This should change once [#22](https://github.com/SUPERAndroidAnalyzer/super/issues/22) is
implemented.

Once configured, the use is simple: Move the *.apk* file that you want to test to the `downloads`
folder. If the folder does not exist, you will need to create it. The name of the *.apk* file
should be `{package_name}.apk`. For example: `com.instagram.android.apk`. After that, running SUPER
is as easy as running this:

```
super {package_name}
```

If SUPER is installed in the current directory, in Unix, you will need to run `./super` instead.
The package name will be the *.apk* file name without the extension. So in the example above, the
command would be this:

```
super com.instagram.android
```

This will decompress all the files in the `dist/{package_name}` folder, analyze them with the rules
in the `rules.json` file (and configuration in the `config.toml` file) and generate the results in
the `results/{package_name}` folder.

In the results page, an `index.html` file will contain the report, while a `report.json` file will
have a machine readable format of that report. In the case of using the *verbose* mode (see below),
the report will also be shown in the terminal.

You can learn about more specific use cases by running:

```
super --help
```
