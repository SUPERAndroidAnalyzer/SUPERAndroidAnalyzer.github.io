Developing SUPER is an effort of many individuals. We have been developing SUPER for free for almost
a year now, and we would like to focus all our efforts in developing SUPER as free and open
software and do it for free. That's why we have added a donation button to the web page. You can
donate any amount you want, so, even if you are not a developer but would like to contribute, you
can do it by clicking the button below:

<form style="text-align:center" action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="K32C48SSW3VB6">
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">
