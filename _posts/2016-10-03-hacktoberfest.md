[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a one month long event organized by
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), where any
developer can get a cool T-Shirt by contributing to open source projects. For that, developers only
need to create four pull requests. And SUPER is one of the projects where you can contribute.

If you want to contribute to SUPER and get a great T-Shirt, it's as simple as fixing one of the
[picked issues](https://github.com/SUPERAndroidAnalyzer/super/labels/Hacktoberfest) and solving it.
If you submit four pull requests between your SUPER contribution and any other repositories you
contribute to, you will get your Hacktoberfest T-shirt and our inmense gratitude.

If you want to contribute to SUPER, you only need to
[fork](https://github.com/SUPERAndroidAnalyzer/super) the project and follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/SUPERAndroidAnalyzer/super/blob/master/contributing.md). Remember to
open pull requests to `develop` branch.
